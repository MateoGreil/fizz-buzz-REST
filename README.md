# fizz-buzz-REST
simple REST api in golang

### Why in golang ?
I wanted to improve my golang, instead of sinking in ruby

### Why this strange directories ? This is not the golang way of life !
That's my second project in golang, I haven't any pair, any people to talk about golang, so I don't know what is the way of life in golang, sorry for that. I'm going to improve insanely fast with pairs.
